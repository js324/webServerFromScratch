# Things To Do:
     - Refactor respond (delegate responsibility to specific load)?
     - Decide if you want to make this more web server or web framework (or both)
          - Model web framework functionality to be more like node, flask, spring (add action functionality)
               - Make it more of application server
          - Or model more like web server (nginx) -- web server is more for static content (like what we have)
          - Focus on HTTP functionality like pipelining, parsing headers, etc.
     - Profile/Benchmark it still
     - Start creating tests 
     - Make it header only library
     - Update CMake files
